                A community or group of living organisms that live in and interact with eachother in a specific environment. All of earth's species work together to maintain their ecosystem. For example, grass in pastures feed cattle, and cattle produce manure that enriches the soil. This cycle sustains life and supports human needs, including food, clothing, and medicine.

              <p class="text">
                The variety of living species on earth, including plants, animals, bacteria, and fungi. Biodiversity is essential for ecological stability, economic resources, and cultural heritage.
                Biodiversity plays a crucial role in our lives. Here are some key benefits:
              </p>
              <p class="text hide">
                Health and Food Security: Biodiversity provides a wide variety of fruits, vegetables, and animal products essential for a healthy diet. Local produce adapted to specific conditions enhances resilience against pests and extreme weather. Unfortunately, poor-quality diets still lead to micronutrient deficiencies in one-third of the world’s population.
                Ecosystem Services: Biodiverse ecosystems support essential services like pollination, nutrient cycling, and water purification. These services contribute to human well-being and economic stability.
                Climate Change Mitigation:
              </p>
               <p class="text hide">
                Biodiversity helps combat climate change by maintaining healthy ecosystems and sequestering carbon. Protecting forests, wetlands, and other habitats is crucial for climate resilience.
                Economic Value: Biodiversity contributes to economic opportunities, such as ecotourism and sustainable resource use. Without diverse pollinators, plants, and soils, our supermarkets would lack produce.
                Cultural Identity: Biodiversity is intertwined with culture, traditions, and identity. It enriches our lives and connects us to the natural world. Preserving biodiversity benefits not only the environment but also our health and prosperity!

            <h1>Extinction</h1>
            <div class="texts_3">

              <p class="text">
                Extinction happens when environmental factors or evolutionary problems cause a species to die out. The disappearance of species from Earth is ongoing, and rates have varied over time. A quarter of mammals is at risk of extinction.
              </p>
              <p class="text hide">
                To some extent, extinction is natural. Changes to habitats and poor reproductive trends are among the factors that can make a species’ death rate higher than its birth rate for long enough that eventually, none are left.
              </p>
              <p class="text hide">
                The causes of extinction:
                Humans cause others to become extinct by hunting, overharvesting, introducing invasive species to the wild, polluting, and changing wetlands and forests to croplands and urban areas. Even the rapid growth of the human population is causing extinction by ruining natural habitats.
              
              </p>
              <p class="text hide">
                Among the most famous species driven to extinction by humans is the dodo, a bird that primarily lived in the island nation of Mauritius and was popularized by its appearance in Lewis Carroll’s book “Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland.” Dodos were first mentioned by Dutch sailors in the late 16th century and last seen in 1662 after having been hunted to extinction. Passenger pigeons, billions of which frequently blanketed North American skies when Europeans arrived on the continent, went extinct when the last one died at the Cincinnati Zoo in 1914.
              </p>
              <p class="text hide">
                Six mass extinctions :
              </p>
              <p class="text hide">
                Fossils show that there have been five previous periods of history when an unusually high number of extinctions occurred in what are known as mass extinctions. Most of the Earth’s species went extinct roughly 266 million to 252 million years ago in the Permian extinction.

                Those losses, however, also paved the way for dinosaurs to evolve into existence, as mass extinctions create a chance for new species to emerge. Dinosaurs met their end about 65 million years ago in another mass extinction at the end of the Cretaceous period. Scientists believe that volcanic eruptions in India caused global warming that also may have contributed to the mass extinction.
              </p>
              <p class="text hide">    
                Slowly increasing surface temperatures caused by heightened levels of greenhouse gases likely will cause many species to move toward the Earth’s poles and higher up into the mountains to stay in habitats with the same climates. But not all species will be able to adapt quickly enough to stave off extinction and many are expected to perish.
                
                Extinction happens on some scale all the time, as organisms adapt and outcompete others. It has been estimated that extinction has claimed at least 99 percent of all species that have ever lived.

                Disruption of the Arctic Food Chain: Polar bears are apex predators, and their main food source is seals. If polar bears go extinct, it would disrupt the Arctic food chain. Seals would likely experience population growth, affecting other species that rely on them for food. This imbalance could have cascading effects throughout the ecosystem.
                Impact on Other Species: Polar bears regulate the populations of other species, such as seals and fish. Their absence could lead to overpopulation of seals, which in turn affects fish populations. This ripple effect could impact the entire ecosystem.
                Loss of Keystone Species: Polar bears are considered a keystone species,
              </p><p class="text hide">
                meaning their presence significantly influences the structure and function of their habitat. Their disappearance could destabilize the Arctic ecosystem, affecting various interconnected species2.
                Cultural and Spiritual Significance: For indigenous peoples in the Arctic, polar bears hold immense cultural and spiritual significance. Their extinction would result in the loss of an important symbol and connection to their heritage2.
                Global Consequences: Beyond the Arctic, polar bears’ extinction could contribute to climate change. The loss of sea ice due to global warming affects not only polar bears but also the entire planet. Sea ice reflects sunlight, helping regulate Earth’s temperature. Without it, more heat is absorbed, exacerbating climate change1.
                While there is uncertainty about the exact timeline, scientists estimate that polar bears could go extinct sometime between 2050 and 2100 if current trends continue. However, conservation efforts are crucial to prevent this scenario and protect these magnificent creatures and their habitat.

              What would happen if bees went extinct?
            </h1>
            <div class="texts_7">
              <p class="text">
                First, I will explain pollination. Pollination, transfer of pollen grains from the stamens, the flower parts that produce them, to the ovule-bearing organs or to the ovules themselves. In plants such as conifers and cycads, in which the ovules are exposed, the pollen is simply caught in a drop of fluid secreted by the ovule. In flowering plants, however, the ovules are contained within a hollow organ called the pistil, and the pollen is deposited on the pistil’s receptive surface, the stigma. There the pollen germinates and gives rise to a pollen tube, which grows down through the pistil toward one of the ovules in its base. In an act of double fertilization, one of the two sperm cells within the pollen tube fuses with the egg cell of the ovule, making possible the development of an embryo, and the other cell combines with the two subsidiary sexual nuclei of the ovule, which initiates formation of a reserve food tissue, the endosperm. The growing ovule then transforms itself into a seed.

              </p><p class="text hide">
                As a prerequisite for fertilization, pollination is essential to the production of fruit and seed crops and plays an important part in programs designed to improve plants by breeding. Furthermore, studies of pollination are invaluable for understanding the evolution of flowering plants and their distribution in the world today. As sedentary organisms, plants usually must enlist the services of external agents for pollen transport. In flowering plants, these are (roughly in order of diminishing importance) insects, wind, birds, mammals, and water.

                As far as important species go, bees are top of the list. They are critical pollinators: they pollinate 70 of the around 100 crop species that feed 90% of the world. 
              </p><p class="text hide">
                That’s only the start. We may lose all the plants that bees pollinate, all of the animals that eat those plants and so on up the food chain. Which means a world without bees could struggle to sustain the global human population of 7 billion. Our supermarkets would have half the amount of fruit and vegetables.

                It gets worse. We are losing bees at an alarming rate. Possible reasons include the loss of flower meadows, the crab-like varroa mite that feasts on their blood, climate change, and use of pesticides.

                As the world's average temperatures creep higher, marine animals are far more vulnerable to extinctions than their earthbound counterparts, according to a new analysis of more than 400 cold-blooded species.
  
                With fewer ways to seek refuge from warming, ocean-dwelling species are disappearing from their habitats at twice the rate of those on land.
              </p><p class="text hide">

                The study, led by researchers from New Jersey's Rutgers University, is the first to compare the impacts of higher temperatures in the ocean and on land for a range of cold-blooded wildlife, from fish and mollusks to lizards and dragonflies. 
  
                As the oceans continue to absorb heat trapped in the atmosphere from carbon dioxide pollution, bringing waters to their warmest point in decades, undersea denizens don't have the luxury of ducking into a shady spot or a burrow.
