              <p class="text">
                The variety of living species on earth, including plants, animals, bacteria, and fungi. Biodiversity is essential for ecological stability, economic resources, and cultural heritage.
                Biodiversity plays a crucial role in our lives. Here are some key benefits:
                Health and Food Security: Biodiversity provides a wide variety of fruits, vegetables, and animal products essential for a healthy diet. Local produce adapted to specific conditions enhances resilience against pests and extreme weather. Unfortunately, poor-quality diets still lead to micronutrient deficiencies in one-third of the world’s population.
              </p>
              <p class="text">
                Ecosystem Services: Biodiverse ecosystems support essential services like pollination, nutrient cycling, and water purification. These services contribute to human well-being and economic stability.
                Climate Change Mitigation:
                Biodiversity helps combat climate change by maintaining healthy ecosystems and sequestering carbon. Protecting forests, wetlands, and other habitats is crucial for climate resilience.
                Economic Value: Biodiversity contributes to economic opportunities, such as ecotourism and sustainable resource use. Without diverse pollinators, plants, and soils, our supermarkets would lack produce.
                Cultural Identity: Biodiversity is intertwined with culture, traditions, and identity. It enriches our lives and connects us to the natural world. Preserving biodiversity benefits not only the environment but also our health and prosperity!

            <h1>Extinction</h1>
            <div class="texts_3">

              <p class="text">
                Extinction happens when environmental factors or evolutionary problems cause a species to die out. The disappearance of species from Earth is ongoing, and rates have varied over time. A quarter of mammals is at risk of extinction.
                To some extent, extinction is natural. Changes to habitats and poor reproductive trends are among the factors that can make a species’ death rate higher than its birth rate for long enough that eventually, none are left.

              </p>

              <p class="text">
                The causes of extinction:
                Humans cause others to become extinct by hunting, overharvesting, introducing invasive species to the wild, polluting, and changing wetlands and forests to croplands and urban areas. Even the rapid growth of the human population is causing extinction by ruining natural habitats.
                Among the most famous species driven to extinction by humans is the dodo, a bird that primarily lived in the island nation of Mauritius and was popularized by its appearance in Lewis Carroll’s book “Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland.” Dodos were first mentioned by Dutch sailors in the late 16th century and last seen in 1662 after having been hunted to extinction. Passenger pigeons, billions of which frequently blanketed North American skies when Europeans arrived on the continent, went extinct when the last one died at the Cincinnati Zoo in 1914.

            </h1>
            <div class="texts_4">
              <p class="text">
                Fossils show that there have been five previous periods of history when an unusually high number of extinctions occurred in what are known as mass extinctions. Most of the Earth’s species went extinct roughly 266 million to 252 million years ago in the Permian extinction.

                Those losses, however, also paved the way for dinosaurs to evolve into existence, as mass extinctions create a chance for new species to emerge. Dinosaurs met their end about 65 million years ago in another mass extinction at the end of the Cretaceous period. Scientists believe that volcanic eruptions in India caused global warming that also may have contributed to the mass extinction.
              </p>
              <p class="text">    
                Slowly increasing surface temperatures caused by heightened levels of greenhouse gases likely will cause many species to move toward the Earth’s poles and higher up into the mountains to stay in habitats with the same climates. But not all species will be able to adapt quickly enough to stave off extinction and many are expected to perish.
                
                Extinction happens on some scale all the time, as organisms adapt and outcompete others. It has been estimated that extinction has claimed at least 99 percent of all species that have ever lived.

              <p class="text">
                Polar bears play a crucial role in the Arctic ecosystem, and their extinction would have far-reaching consequences.
                Here’s what could happen if polar bears were to go extinct:
                Disruption of the Arctic Food Chain: Polar bears are apex predators, and their main food source is seals. If polar bears go extinct, it would disrupt the Arctic food chain. Seals would likely experience population growth, affecting other species that rely on them for food. This imbalance could have cascading effects throughout the ecosystem.

              </p>
              <p class="text">

                Impact on Other Species: Polar bears regulate the populations of other species, such as seals and fish. Their absence could lead to overpopulation of seals, which in turn affects fish populations. This ripple effect could impact the entire ecosystem.
                Loss of Keystone Species: Polar bears are considered a keystone species,
                meaning their presence significantly influences the structure and function of their habitat. Their disappearance could destabilize the Arctic ecosystem, affecting various interconnected species2.
              </p>
              <p class="text">
                Cultural and Spiritual Significance: For indigenous peoples in the Arctic, polar bears hold immense cultural and spiritual significance. Their extinction would result in the loss of an important symbol and connection to their heritage2.
                Global Consequences: Beyond the Arctic, polar bears’ extinction could contribute to climate change. The loss of sea ice due to global warming affects not only polar bears but also the entire planet. Sea ice reflects sunlight, helping regulate Earth’s temperature. Without it, more heat is absorbed, exacerbating climate change1.
                While there is uncertainty about the exact timeline, scientists estimate that polar bears could go extinct sometime between 2050 and 2100 if current trends continue. However, conservation efforts are crucial to prevent this scenario and protect these magnificent creatures and their habitat.

              <p class="text">
                First, I will explain pollination. Pollination, transfer of pollen grains from the stamens, the flower parts that produce them, to the ovule-bearing organs or to the ovules themselves. In plants such as conifers and cycads, in which the ovules are exposed, the pollen is simply caught in a drop of fluid secreted by the ovule.
              </p>
              <p class="text">
                In flowering plants, however, the ovules are contained within a hollow organ called the pistil, and the pollen is deposited on the pistil’s receptive surface, the stigma. There the pollen germinates and gives rise to a pollen tube, which grows down through the pistil toward one of the ovules in its base. In an act of double fertilization, one of the two sperm cells within the pollen tube fuses with the egg cell of the ovule, making possible the development of an embryo, and the other cell combines with the two subsidiary sexual nuclei of the ovule, which initiates formation of a reserve food tissue, the endosperm. The growing ovule then transforms itself into a seed.
              </p>
              <p class="text">
                As a prerequisite for fertilization, pollination is essential to the production of fruit and seed crops and plays an important part in programs designed to improve plants by breeding. Furthermore, studies of pollination are invaluable for understanding the evolution of flowering plants and their distribution in the world today. As sedentary organisms, plants usually must enlist the services of external agents for pollen transport. In flowering plants, these are (roughly in order of diminishing importance) insects, wind, birds, mammals, and water.

                As far as important species go, bees are top of the list. They are critical pollinators: they pollinate 70 of the around 100 crop species that feed 90% of the world. 
                
              </p>
              <p class="text">
                That’s only the start. We may lose all the plants that bees pollinate, all of the animals that eat those plants and so on up the food chain. Which means a world without bees could struggle to sustain the global human population of 7 billion. Our supermarkets would have half the amount of fruit and vegetables.

                It gets worse. We are losing bees at an alarming rate. Possible reasons include the loss of flower meadows, the crab-like varroa mite that feasts on their blood, climate change, and use of pesticides.

                As the world's average temperatures creep higher, marine animals are far more vulnerable to extinctions than their earthbound counterparts, according to a new analysis of more than 400 cold-blooded species.
  
                With fewer ways to seek refuge from warming, ocean-dwelling species are disappearing from their habitats at twice the rate of those on land.
              </p><p class="text">

                The study, led by researchers from New Jersey's Rutgers University, is the first to compare the impacts of higher temperatures in the ocean and on land for a range of cold-blooded wildlife, from fish and mollusks to lizards and dragonflies. 
  
                As the oceans continue to absorb heat trapped in the atmosphere from carbon dioxide pollution, bringing waters to their warmest point in decades, undersea denizens don't have the luxury of ducking into a shady spot or a burrow.
              </p><p class="text">
                Narrow safety margins
                The scientists calculated "thermal safety margins" for 88 marine and 318 terrestrial species, determining how much warming they can tolerate and how much exposure they have to those heat thresholds. The safety margins were slimmest near the equator for ocean dwellers and near the midlatitudes on land.
                
                For many, the heat is already too much. At the warm edges of the marine species' ranges, the study found, more than half had disappeared from historical territory as a result of warming. The rate for these local extinctions is twice that seen on land.
                
              </p><p class="text">
                Even just a degree or half-degree boost, can lead to trouble finding food, reproducing, and other devastating effects. While some species will be able to migrate to new territory, others—coral and sea anemones, for example—can't move and will simply go extinct.

                The results of this study are a further wake-up call that we need to protect forests and other natural environments because of the temperature buffer that they provide wildlife in a warming world."

                When a plant species goes extinct, it can lead to a whole cascade of extinctions in other organisms that rely on them. The effects of species extinction on the ecosystem include:
                Loss of biodiversity
                Imbalance in the food chain
                Destruction of habitats
                Effects on humans
              </p><p class="text">

                Since the 1750s, at least 571 species of plants have gone extinct in the wild. This alarming pace of extinction is as much as 500 times the natural or background extinction rate for plants. While some species have been rediscovered or reclassified, 571 are still presumed extinct. Human activity, including habitat loss, invasive species, and diseases, has played a significant role in these extinctions. It’s crucial that we continue conservation efforts to prevent further losses and protect our planet’s biodiversity. 
              </p><p class="text">
                Almost 600 plant species have been lost from the wild in the last 250 years, according to a comprehensive study.

                The number is based on actual extinctions rather than estimates, and is twice that of all bird, mammal and amphibian extinctions combined.
                
                Scientists say plant extinction is occurring up to 500 times faster than what would be expected naturally.
                
                In May, a UN report estimated that one million animal and plant species were threatened with extinction.
                
              </p><p class="text">
                Why does plant extinction matter?
                All life on Earth depends on plants, which provide the oxygen we breathe and the food we eat.

                Plant extinctions can lead to a whole cascade of extinctions in other organisms that rely on them, for instance insects that use plants for food and for laying their eggs.

                "Millions of other species depend on plants for their survival, humans included, so knowing which plants we are losing and from where, will feed back into conservation programmes targeting other organisms as well," she explained.

              </p>
              <p class="text">
                What lessons can we learn?
                The researchers are calling for a number of measures to stop plant extinction:
                
                Record all the plants across the world
                Support herbaria, which preserve plant specimens for posterity
                Support botanists who carry out vital research
                Teach our children to see and recognise local plants.
                
                More than eight plant species have disappeared every three years, on average, since 1900. This pace of extinction is as much as 500 times plants’ natural or background extinction rate.

            <div class="texts_9">
              <p class="text"> 
                10 things you can do to stop this:

                1. Learn about endangered species in your area. 
                Teach your friends and family about the wonderful wildlife, birds, fish and plants that live near you. The first step to protecting endangered species is learning about how interesting and important they are. Our natural world provides us with many indispensable services including clean air and water, food and medicinal sources, commercial, aesthetic and recreational benefits.  
                
              </p>
              <p class="text">
                2. Visit a national wildlife refuge, park or other open space
                . These protected lands provide habitat to many native wildlife, birds, fish and plants. Scientists tell us the best way to protect endangered species is to protect the places where they live. Get involved by volunteering at your local nature center or wildlife refuge. Go wildlife or bird watching in nearby parks. Wildlife related recreation creates millions of jobs and supports local businesses. 
              </p>
              <p class="text">
                3. Make your home wildlife friendly. 
                Secure garbage in shelters or cans with locking lids, feed pets indoors and lock pet doors at night to avoid attracting wild animals into your home. Reduce your use of water in your home and garden so that animals that live in or near water can have a better chance of survival. Disinfect bird baths often to avoid disease transmission. Place decals on windows to deter bird collisions. Millions of birds die every year because of collisions with windows. You can help reduce the number of collisions simply by placing decals on the windows in your home and office.  
                
              </p>
              <p class="text">
                4. Native plants provide food and shelter for native wildlife. Attracting native insects like bees and butterflies can help pollinate your plants. The spread of non-native species has greatly impacted native populations around the world. Invasive species compete with native species for resources and habitat. They can even prey on native species directly, forcing native species towards extinction.

                5. Herbicides and pesticides may keep yards looking nice but they are in fact hazardous pollutants that affect wildlife at many levels. Many herbicides and pesticides take a long time to degrade and build up in the soils or throughout the food chain. Predators such as hawks, owls and coyotes can be harmed if they eat poisoned animals. Some groups of animals such as amphibians are particularly vulnerable to these chemical pollutants and suffer greatly as a result of the high levels of herbicides and pesticides in their habitat.

                6. Slow down when driving. 
                Many animals live in developed areas and this means they must navigate a landscape full of human hazards. One of the biggest obstacles to wildlife living in developed areas is roads. Roads divide habitat and present a constant hazard to any animal attempting to cross from one side to the other. So when you’re out and about, slow down and keep an eye out for wildlife.

                7. Recycle and buy sustainable products. 
                Buy recycled paper, sustainable products like bamboo and Forest Stewardship Council wood products to protect forest species. Never buy furniture made from wood from rainforests. Recycle your cell phones, because a mineral used in cell phones and other electronics is mined in gorilla habitat. Minimize your use of palm oil because forests where tigers live are being cut down to plant palm plantations.

                8. Never purchase products made from threatened or endangered species.
                Overseas trips can be exciting and fun, and everyone wants a souvenir. But sometimes the souvenirs are made from species nearing extinction. Avoid supporting the market in illegal wildlife including: tortoise-shell, ivory, coral. Also, be careful of products including fur from tigers, polar bears, sea otters and other endangered wildlife, crocodile skin, live monkeys or apes, most live birds including parrots, macaws, cockatoos and finches, some live snakes, turtles and lizards, some orchids, cacti and cycads, medicinal products made from rhinos, tiger or Asiatic black bear.

                9. Harassing wildlife is cruel and illegal. Shooting, trapping, or forcing a threatened or endangered animal into captivity is also illegal and can lead to their extinction. Don’t participate in this activity, and report it as soon as you see it to your local state or federal wildlife enforcement office.

                10. Protect wildlife habitat. 
                Perhaps the greatest threat that faces many species is the widespread destruction of habitat. Scientists tell us the best way to protect endangered species is to protect the special places where they live. Wildlife must have places to find food, shelter and raise their young. Logging, oil and gas drilling, over-grazing and development all result habitat destruction. Endangered species habitat should be protected and these impacts minimized.
              </p>  
              <p class="text">
                By protecting habitat, entire communities of animals and plants can be protected together. Parks, wildlife refuges, and other open space should be protected near your community. Open space also provides us with great places to visit and enjoy. Support wildlife habitat and open space protection in your community. When you are buying a house, consider your impact on wildlife habitat.
